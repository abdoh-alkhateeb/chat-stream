# ChatStream

Welcome to ChatStream, a real-time chat application where users can join different rooms and exchange messages.

## Project Structure

This repository is divided into two main components:
1. **Backend**: Handles the server-side logic, database interactions, and API endpoints.
2. **Frontend**: Manages the client-side interface, user interactions, and real-time updates.

Each component has its own setup instructions provided in their respective README files.

## Setup Instructions

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Any other specific requirements listed in the backend and frontend README files

### Backend Setup

2. Follow the instructions in the `backend/README.md` to set up and run the backend server.

### Frontend Setup
